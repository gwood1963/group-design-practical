To run test.js, use live server extension for VSCode, and run main.html using Live Server

///////////////////////////////////// Round 1 ////////////////////////////////////

Works as desired, the GUI could use some work but not too important


///////////////////////////////////// Round 2 ////////////////////////////////////

Done: 
- Created a way to generate a graph of n nodes with no edges

TODO: 
(*) means in progress/mostly done

implement functions in Round2.js: 
*- Add roads (edges)
*- Delete roads (edges)
*- Keep track of economy (money bank, cost of roads, etc.)
- implement circulation with demands
- implement a way to convert circulations to flow networks and thus solve them 

*For cost of roads, we consider two factors (directly proportional): 
- length of road
- capacity
